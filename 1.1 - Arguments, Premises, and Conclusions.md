## Notes:
- [[Logic]]
	- The Science that evaluates arguments; 
- ### Arguments
	- [[Argument]]
		- A group of statements, one or more of which (the premises) are claimed to provide support form or reasons to believe, one of the others (the conclusion); 
			- Two Basic Groups of Arguments
				- Arguments which premises support the conclusion
				- Arguments which premises do not support the conclusion even though they claim they do
		- [[Statements]]
			- a sentence that is either true or false, typically declarative sentence or a sentence that could stand as a declarative sentence
			- [[Truth Values]] of a Statement
				- The attribute by which a statement is either true or false
			- Statements that make up an argument are divided into one or more premises and exactly one conclusion
				- [[Premise]]
					- A statement in an argument that sets forth evidence
				- [[Conclusion]]
					- The statement in an argument that the premises are claimed to support or imply
				- *All Film starts are Celebrities* - Premise
				- *Hale Berry is a film Star* - Premise
				- *Therefore, Halle Berry is a Celebrity* - Conclusion
					- [[Conclusion Indicators]]
						- A word that provides a clue to identifying a conclusion
							- "Tortured prisoners will say anything just to relieve the pain. *Consequently*, torture is not a reliable method of interrogation"
					- [[Premise Indicators]]
						- A word that provides a clue to identifying a premise 
						- "Expectant mothers should never use recreational drugs, *since* the use of these drugs jeopardize the development of the fetus"
				- [[Inference]]
					- The Reasoning process expressed by an argument
				- [[Proposition]]
					- The information content of a statement
### Note on the History of Logic
- [[Aristotle]]
	- Father of Ancient Logic
	- devised systemic criteria for analyzing and evaluating arguments
	- [[Syllogistic Logic]]
		- The logic that deals with categorical propositions and categorical syllogisms
		- fundamental elements are *terms* and arguments are evaluated as good or bad depending on how the terms are arranged in an argument
	- [[Modal Logic]]
		- A kind of logic that deals with concepts such as possibility, necessity, belief, and doubt
- [[Chrysippus]]
	- One of the founders of the Stoic School
		- developed a logic in which the fundamental elements were *whole propositions*
		- Treated every [[Proposition]] as either true or false and developed rules for determining the truth or falsity of compound propositions from the truth or falsity of their components
- [[Peter Abelard]]
	- First major logician of the Middle Ages
	- Originated a theory of universal that traced the universal character of general terms to concepts in the mind rather than to "natures" existing outside of the mind
		- distinguished arguments that are valid because of form from those that are valid because of content
