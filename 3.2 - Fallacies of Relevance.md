## Notes:
- [[Fallacies of Relevance]]
	- a group of [[Informal Fallacy]] that occur because the premises of an argument are irrelevant to the conclusion.
		- [[Premise]] may are *logically* irrelevant while appearing *psychologically* relevant. [[Conclusion]] may *seem* to follow the premises even though it does not follow logically
### 1. Appeal to Force (*Argumentum ad Baculum:* Appeal to the "Stick")
---
- [[Appeal to Force]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when an arguer threatens a reader or listener for the purpose of getting him or her to accept a [[Conclusion]]
		- The threat is logically irrelevant to the conclusion
			- *Child to playmate: Sesame Street is the best show on TV; and if you don't believe it, I'm going to call my big brother over here and he's going to beat you up*
### 2. Appeal to Pity (*Argumentum ad Misericordiam*)
---
- [[Appeal to Pity]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when an arguer attempts to evoke pity from a reader or listener for the purpose of getting him or her to accept a [[Conclusion]]
		- _Taxpayer to judge:_¬†**Your Honor, I admit that I declared thirteen children as dependents on my tax return, even though I have only two. But if you find me guilty of tax evasion, my reputation will be ruined. I‚Äôll probably lose my job, my poor wife will not be able to have the operation that she desperately needs, and my kids will starve. Surely I am not guilty.**
		- Conclusion is not *Logically* relevant but is *Psychologically* relevant
	- different from an *Argument of Passion* which provides evidence for why a person is genuinely deserving of help or special consideration.
		- show a person is a victim of circumstances and not responsible for the dire straits they are in
### 3. Appeal to the People (*Argumentum ad Populum*)
---
- [[Appeal to the People]]
	- An [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when an arguer plays on certain psychological needs for the purpose of getting the reader or listener to accept a conclusion
	- **Direct and Indirect Approaches**
		- *Direct Approach*
			- Arguer, addressing large group of people, excites the emotions of the crowd to win acceptance for his conclusion
				- Used by *propagandists* and *demagogues* such as [[Adolf Hitler]] and speech writers for the Democratic and Republican parties
			- [[Appeal to Fear]]
				- *fear mongering*
				- a variety of [[Appeal to the People]] that occurs when an arguer trumps up a fear of something and then uses that fear as the [[Premise]] for some [[Conclusion]]
					- **The fear used is not supported by any solid evidence and usually rests on nothing more than irrational suspicion created by repeating a message or rumor over and over again.**
				- *Example:*
					- Lyndon Johnson instilling fear in everyone that if Barry Goldwater won the precedency, he might use nuclear weapons in Vietnam.
		- *Indirect Approach*
			- arguer aims his or her appeal not at the crowd as a whole but at one or more individuals separately, focusing on some aspect of those individuals' relationship to the crowd.
				- [[Bandwagon Argument]]
					- A variety of the [[Appeal to the People]] fallacy that occurs when the arguer plays on the readers' or listener's need to feel apart of a group
						- *Everyone nowadays is on a low-carb diet. Therefore, you should go on a low-carb diet, too*
					- Plays on peoples desire to fit in
				- [[Appeal to vanity]]
					- a variety of the [[Appeal to the People]] fallacy that occurs when an arguer plays on the vanity of the reader or listener
						- often used by advertisers and parents
							- *Of course you want to look as fresh and beautiful as Ellen DeGeneres. That means you will want to buy and use Cover Girl cosmetics*
							- *Daniel Craig wears an Omega wristwatch. Thus, if you want to be like him, you will buy and wear an omega watch too.*
				- [[Appeal to Snobbery]]
					- a variety of [[Appeal to the People]] fallacy that occurs when the arguer plays on the readers' need to feel superior
						- *The Lexus 400 series is not for everyone. Only those with considerable means and accomplishment will acquire one. To show the world that you are among the select few, you will want to purchase and drive one of these distinguished automobiles.* 
				- [[Appeal to Tradition]]
					- a fallacy that occurs when an arguer cites the fact that something has become a tradition as grounds for a conclusion 
						- *Traditionally, professional sporting events have been preceded by the national anthem. Therefore, professional sporting events should continue to be preceded by the national anthem*
### 4. Argument against the Person (*Argumentum ad Hominem*)
---
- [[Argument against the Person]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when an arguer verbally attacks the person of a second arguer for the purpose of discrediting his or her argument
		- **MUST HAVE TWO ARGUERS AND ONE MUST BE ATTEMPTING TO PLACE THE OTHER IN A BAD LIGHT**
		- **ATTACKS MUST HAVE NO RELEVANCY TO THE CONCLUSION**
		- #### Three Forms:
			- [[ad hominem abusive]]
				- A variety of the [[Argument against the Person]] that occurs when an arguer verbally abuses a second arguer  for the purpose of discrediting that person's argument
					- *Television entertainer Bill Maher argues that religion is just a log of foolish nonsense. But Maher is an arrogant, shameless, self-righteous pig. Obviously his arguments are not worth listening to.*
						- Aimed at attacking Maher instead of addressing the Argument
					- *Billionaire investor Warren Buffet argues that wealthy people should be required to pay more taxes. I would remind Mr. Buffet that he is free to send a check to the Department of the Treasury any time he likes*
						- Instead of replying to the argument, the arguer directs attention to Mr. Buffet himself and aims to show that Mr. Buffet is insincere
			- [[ad hominem circumstantial]]
				- a variety of the [[Argument against the Person]] fallacy that occurs when an arguer cites circumstances that affect a second arguer, for the purpose of discrediting that person's argument
					- *The Dalai Lama argues that China has no business in Tibet and that the west should do something about it. But the Dalai Lama just wants the Chinese to leave so he can return as leader. Naturally he argues this way. Therefore, we should reject his arguments*
						- Attempts to discredit the Dalai Lama by calling attention to circumstances that affect him. This is irrelevant to whether his premises support a conclusion. 
			- [[tu quoque]]
				- a variety of the [[Argument against the Person]] fallacy that occurs when an arguer shifts the burden of guilt onto a second arguer for the purpose of discrediting his or her argument 
					- attempts to make the first arguer appear hypocritical or arguing in bad faith.
					- *Kim Kardashian argues that women should not have children out of wedlock. But who is she to talk. She gave birth to her daughter North without being married. Clearly Kardashian's argument is not worth listening to.*
	- #### Examples of Non-ad hominems
		- *North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has murdered political opponents and their entire families, and he has committed other crimes including extermination, enslavement, torture, and rape. Also, he has threatened U. S. cities with nuclear annihilation. Kim Jong-un is therefore a thoroughly despicable and disgusting human being.*
			- The conclusion is that KiM Jong is a bad person and the premises support that conclusion
### 5. Accident
---
- [[Accident Fallacy]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when a general rule is wrongly applied to an atypical specific case 
		- *Freedom of Speech is a constitutionally guaranteed right. Therefore, John Q. Radical should not be arrested for his speech that incited the riot last week.*
### 6. Straw Man
---
- [[Straw Man Fallacy]]
	- **ALWAYS INVOLVE TWO ARGUERS**
	- **DISTORTS THE ORIGINAL ARGUMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ARGUE AGAINST**
	- a [[Fallacy]] that occurs when the arguer misinterprets an opponent's position for the purpose of more easily attacking it, demolishes the misinterpreted argument, and then proceeds to conclude that the original argument has been demolished
		- *Mr. Goldberg has argued against prayer in the public schools. Obviously Mr. Goldberg advocates atheism. But atheism is what they used to have in Russia. Atheism leads to the suppression of all religions and the replacement of God by an omnipotent state. Is that what we want for this country? I hardly think so. Clearly Mr. Goldberg‚Äôs argument is nonsense.*
			- Mr. Goldberg presents an argument against Prayer in public schools, while the second arguer attacks Goldberg's argument by equating it with an argument for atheism. 
### 7. Missing the Point (Ignoratio Elenchi)
---
- [[Missing the Point Fallacy]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when the [[Premise]] of an argument entails one particular conclusion but a completely different conclusion is actually drawn.
		- *Crimes of theft and robbery have been increasing at an alarming rate lately. The conclusion is obvious: We must reinstate the death penalty immediately*
			- Two Conclusions implied by the premise are either:
				- "We should provide increased police protection in vulnerable neighborhoods"
				- "We should initiate programs to eliminate the cause of the crimes"
			- Reinstating the death penalty is not logical nor are theft and robbery capital crimes
### 8. Red Herring
---
- [[Red Herring]]
	- **IGNORES THE OPPONENTS ARGUMENTS**
	- A [[Fallacy]] that occurs when the arguer diverts the attention of the reader or listener by addressing extraneous issues and finishes by presuming that some conclusion has been established. 
		- Generates *new* set of [[Premise]]s from changing the subject and uses them to draw a conclusion 
		- *Environmentalists are continually harping about the dangers of nuclear power. Unfortunately, electricity is dangerous no matter where it comes from. Every year hundreds of people are electrocuted by accident. Since most of these accidents are caused by carelessness, they could be avoided if people would just exercise greater caution.**
			- Original issue is whether nuclear power is dangerous. The arguer changes the subject to the danger of electrocution and proceeds to draw a conclusion about that.
		- *Professor Conway complains of inadequate parking on our campus. But did you hear that Conway‚Äôs eldest son, Jasper, was convicted a year ago of embezzlement? Jasper managed to steal half a million dollars from the First National Bank before officials figured out what was going on. It‚Äôs really important that bank officials be constantly vigilant. Okay, let‚Äôs move on to the next topic.*
			- Changed the subject to some flashy topic and distracting from the main argument
