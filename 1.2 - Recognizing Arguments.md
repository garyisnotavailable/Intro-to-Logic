## Notes:
- A passage contains an argument if it's trying to prove something
- **What is Needed for a Passage to Contain an Argument**:
	- At least one of the statements must claim to present evidence or reasons
	- There must be a claim that the alleged evidence supports or implies something, that is, a claim that something follows from the alleged evidence or reasons
- Premises do not need to present actual evidence or true reasons that support the conclusion, but they must *claim* to present evidence and there must be a *claim* that the evidence supports or implies something
- ##### Eminent Logicians - Aristotle 384-322 B.C.E
	- [[Aristotle]]
		- originator of logic
		- *Logic*
			- the study of the process by which a statement follows by necessity from one or more other statements
			- **The Four Categorical Propositions** - [[Categorical Proposition]]
				- *Universal*
				- *Particular*
				- *Affirmative*
				- *Negative*
			- [[Square of Opposition]]
				- shows how one proposition implies the truth or falsity of another
			- Identified the relations of conversion, obversion and contraposition, which provide the basis for various immediate inferences 
		- [[Categorical Syllogism]]
			- a kind of argument consisting of three categorical propositions
			- can be catalogued in terms of mood and figure
- **Explicit vs. Implicit Claims**
	- [[Explicit Claims]]
		- usually asserted by premise or conclusion indicator words ("thus," "since," "because," "hence," "therefore,")
			- *The Ebola virus has yet to be eradicated, and it kills on average 50 percent of those it infects. Thus, Ebola remains a threat to human health*
			- "thus" expresses the claim that something is being inferred, so it is an argument
	- [[Implicit Claims]]
		- exists if there is an inferential relationship between the statements in a passage, but the passage contains no indicator words
			- *The genetic modification of food is risky business. Genetic engineering can introduce unintended changes into the DNA of the food-producing organism, and these changes can be toxic to the consumer*
				- the inferential relationship between the first statement and the other two constitutes an implicit claim that evidence supports something, so it is an argument
- **Deciding if a claim that is supported or implied by evidence**:
	- Premise and conclusion words
	- the presence of an inferential relationship between the statements
- **BECAREFUL OF PASSAGES WITH INDICATOR WORDS WITH NO ARGUMENTS**
	- Example:
		- *Since Edison invented the phonograph, there have been many technological innovations*
			- *Since* is used in a *temporal* sense - meaning "from the time that" - not an argument
		- *Since Edison invented the phonograph, he deserves credit for a a major technological innovation*
			- *Since* is used in a *logical* sense - the passage is an argument
	- It is not always easy to detect an inferential relationship between statements
		- may help to mentally insert indicator words
### Simple Noninferential Passages
---
- [[Simple Noninferential Passages]]
	- unproblematic passages that lack a claim that anything is being proved
	- contain statements that could be premises or conclusions (or both) but are missing a claim that any potential premise supports a conclusion or that a conclusion is supported by premises
		- *Warnings, advice, statements of belief or opinion, loosely associated statements, and reports*
	- [[Warning]]
		- a form of expression intended to put someone on guard against a dangerous or detrimental situation
			- *Watch out that you don't slip on the ice*
			- *Whatever you do, never confide personal secrets to Blabermouth Bob*
		- if there is no evidence to prove these statements, there is no argument
	- [[Piece of Advice]]
		- a form of expression that makes a recommendation about some future decision or course of conduct
			- *You should keep a few things in mind before buying a used car. Test drive the car at varying speeds and conditions, examine the oil in the crankcase, ask to see service records, and, if possible, have the engine and power train checked by a mechanic*
		- ##### If there is no evidence that is intended to prove anything, there is no argument
	- [[Statement of Belief]] or [[Opinion]]
		- An expression about what someone happens to believe or think about something
			- *We believe that our company must develop and produce outstanding products that will perform a great service or fulfill a need for our customers. We believe that our business must be run at an adequate profit and that the services and products we offer must be better than those offered by competitors.* - (Robert D. Hay and Edmund R. Gray, ‚ÄúIntroduction to Social Responsibility‚Äù)
			- *When I can read the latte menu through the hole in my server‚Äôs earlobe, something is seriously out of whack. What happened to an earring, maybe two, in each lobe? Now any surface is game. Brow, lip, tongue, cheek, nose. I‚Äôve adjusted to untied shoelaces and pants that make mooning irrelevant. But when it comes to piercings, I just can‚Äôt budge.* - (Debra Darvick, ‚ÄúService with a Smile, and Plenty of Metal‚Äù)
		- Neither of these statements asserts any claim that a belief or opinion is supported by evidence, there is no argument
	- [[Loosely Associated Arguments]]
		- may be about the same general subject, but they lack a claim that one of them is proved by the otheres
			- *Not to honor men of worth will keep the people from contention; not to value goods that are hard to come by will keep them from theft; not to display what is desirable will keep them from being unsettled of mind* - (Lao-Tzu, "Thoughts form the Tao Te Ching")
		- there is not claim that any of these statements provides evidence or reasons for believing another, there is no argument
	- [[Report]]
		- consists of a group of statements that convey information about some topic or event
			- *The period of 1648-1789 was one of competition among the primary monarchs of Europe. Wars among the great powers were frequent but limited. France made major efforts to become paramount, but the balance of power operated to French Expansion* - (Steven L. Spiegel, "World Politics in a New Era")
		- These statements could serve a premise of an argument, but because the author makes no claims that they support or imply anything, there is no argument
### Expository Passages
---
- [[Expository Passage]]
	- a kind of discourse that begins with a topic sentence followed by one or more sentences that develop the topic sentence. If the objective is not to prove the topic sentence but only to expand on it, then there is no argument
		- *There are three familiar states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Solid objects ordinarily maintain their shape and volume regardless of their location. A liquid occupies a definite volume, but assumes the shape of the occupied portion of its container. A gas maintains neither shape nor volume. It expands to fill completely whatever container it is in*. - (John W. Hill and Doris K. Kolb,¬†_Chemistry for Changing Times,_¬†7th ed.)
	- in each passage the topic sentence is the first sentence, and the remaining sentences develop and flesh out the topic sentence
	- they lack inferential claims
	- in deciding whether aa passage is an argument
		- determine whether the purpose of the sentences in the passage are just developing the topic or also proving that it is true
### Illustrations
---
- [[Illustration]]
	- an expression involving one or more examples that is intended to show what something means or how it is done
		- *A deciduous tree is any tree that loses its leaves during the winter. For example, maples are deciduous. And so are elms, poplars, hawthorns, and alders.*
	- this is not an argument because it makes no claim that anything is being proved
- [[Arguments from Example]]
	- An argument that purports to prove something by giving one or more examples of it
		- *Although most forms of cancer, if untreated, can cause death, not all cancers are life threatening. For example, basal cell carcinoma, the most common of all skin cancers, can produce disfigurement, but it almost never results in death.*
	- In this passage the example given is intended to prove the truth of "Not all cancers are life threatening." Thus, the passage is an argument
- **Determining if an Illustration is an Argument**
	- Determine whether the passage shows how something is done or what something means, or whether it also purports to prove something
		- helps to note whether the claim being illustrated is one that practically everyone accepts or agrees with. If it is, the passage is probably not an argument (*Authors rarely attempt to prove what everyone already accepts*)
		- If the claim is one that not many people accept or have never thought about, it may be an argument
### Explanations
----
- [[Explanation]]
	- an expression that purports to shed light on some event or phenomenon. The event in question is usually *accepted as matter of fact*
		- *The sky appears blue from the earth‚Äôs surface because light rays from the sun are scattered by particles in the atmosphere.*
			- The sky is blue is an apparent fact. The statement that light rays are scattered is not intended to prove *that* that sky is blue, but show *why it is blue*
		- *Golf balls have a dimpled surface because the dimples reduce air drag, causing the ball to travel farther.*
			- Everyone knows golf balls have dimpled surface. This passage explains *Why* not to prove *that* they do
		- *Navel oranges are called by that name because they have a growth that resembles a human navel on the end opposite the stem.*
			- Sheds light on *Why* they are named that way, not to prove *that* they are named that way
	- Explanation is not an argument because the purpose of the [[Explanans]] is to shed light on the [[Explanandum]] of the event, not to prove that it occurred
		- [[Explanans]] - explains *Why* something is the case
		- [[Premise]] - prove *that* something is the case
	- #### Components of an explanation
		- [[Explanandum]]
			- The component of an explanation that describes the event that is going to be explained
				- *The sky appears blue from the earth's surface*
		- [[Explanans]]
			- The component of an explanation that explains the event indicated by the [[Explanandum]]
				- *Light rays from the sun are scattered by particles in the atmosphere*
	- **Passages that are both an explanation and an Argument**
		- *Women become intoxicated by drinking a smaller amount of alcohol than men because men metabolize part of the alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream, whereas women do not.
		- *Household bleach should never be mixed with ammonia because the combination releases chlorine gas, which is highly poisonous.*
			- Both passages can be used to prove the first statement to those who do not accept it as fact and to shed light on that fact to those who do accept it
			- The passages could be intended to prove the first statement to a person who accepts its truth on blind faith and to shed light
### Conditional Statements
----
- [[Conditional Statement]]
	- an "if ... then ..." statement
		- *If professional football games incite violence in the home, then the widespread approval given to this sport should be reconsidered.*
		- *If Roger Federer has played in more Grand Slam finals than any other contender, then he rightfully deserves the title of world‚Äôs greatest tennis player.*
	- not arguments, because they fail to meet the criteria of an argument
		- at least one statement must claim to present evidence
		- there must be a claim that this evidence implies something
	- There is no claim that either the [[Antecedent]] or the [[Consequent]] presents evidence, there is no assertion that either are true
	- A Conditional Statement may serve as either a [[Premise]] or [[Conclusion]] of an argument
		- *If North Korea is developing nuclear weapons, then North Korea is a threat to world peace. North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, North Korea is a threat to world peace.*
		- *If our borders are porous, then terrorists can enter the country at will. If terrorists can enter the country at will, then all of us are less secure. Therefore, if our borders are porous, then all of us are less secure.*
	- #### Components of a conditional statement
		- [[Antecedent]]
			- The component of a conditional statement immediately following the word "if"
				- *If professional football games incite violence in the home
		- [[Consequent]]
			- The component of a conditional statement that immediately follows the word "then"
				- *then the widespread approval given to this sport should be reconsidered.*
	- #### Relation between conditional statements and arguments
		- A single conditional statement is not an argument
		- A conditional statement may serve as either the [[Premise]] or the [[Conclusion]] (or both) of an argument
		- The inferential content of a conditional statement may be re-expressed to form an argument
	- #### Relationship between necessary and sufficient condition
		- [[Sufficient Condition]]
			- The condition represented by the [[Antecedent]] in a [[Conditional Statement]]
		- [[Necessary Condition]]
			- The condition represented by the [[Consequent]] in a [[Conditional Statement]]
		- *A* is said to be a *Sufficient Condition* for *B* whenever the occurrence of *A* is all that is needed for the occurrence of *B*
			- *Being a dog is a sufficient condition for being an animal*
		- *B* is said to be a *Necessary condition* for *A* whenever *A* cannot occur without the occurrence of *B*
			- *Being an animal is a necessary condition for being a dog*
		- A dog (*A*) is necessarily an animal (*B*), but an animal (*B*) is not necessarily a dog (*A*)
		- **Example**:
			- You are given a large, closed box. Inside the box you are told there is a dog in the box. You know for sure that there is an animal in the box. Being a dog is a [[Sufficient Condition]] for being an animal. However being a dog is **not** a [[Necessary Condition]] for being an animal, because if you are told that in the box is a cat, you can conclude that it contains an animal.
				- *It is not necessary for the box to contain a dog for it to contain an animal. It could equally well contain a cat, mouse or any other animal*
