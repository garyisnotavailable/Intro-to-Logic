## Notes:
- [[Deductive Argument]]
	- An argument incorporating the claim that it is impossible for the conclusion to be false given that the premises are true
		- *The meerkat is a member of the mongoose family. All members of the mongoose family are carnivores. Therefore, it necessarily follows that the meerkat is a carnivore.*
- [[Inductive Argument]]
	- An argument incorporating the claim that it is improbable that the conclusion is false given the the premises are true
		- *The meerkat is closely related to the suricat. The suricat thrives on beetle larvae. Therefore, probably the meerkat thrives on beetle larvae.*
- #### Deciding whether an argument is inductive or deductive
	- the occurrence of special indicator words
		- [[Inductive Indicator Words]]
			- *probably*
			- *improbable*
			- *plausible*
			- *implausible*
			- *likely*
			- *unlikely*
			- *reasonable to conclude*
		- [[Deductive Indicator Words]]
			- *necessarily*
			- *certainly*
			- *absolutely*
			- *definitely*
	- the *actual* strength of the inferential link between [[Premise]] and [[Conclusion]] 
		- [[Deductive Argument]]
			- *All entertainers are extroverts. Stephen Colbert is an entertainer. Therefore, Stephen Colbert is an extrovert.*
		- [[Inductive Argument]] framed like a Deductive argument
			- *The vast majority of entertainers are extroverts. Stephen Colbert is an entertainer. Therefore, Stephen Colbert is an extrovert.*
	- the form or style of argument
### Deductive Argument Forms
---
- [[Argument based on Mathematics]]
	- a [[Deductive Argument]] in which the conclusion depends on some purely arithmetic or geometric computation or measurement
		- Since all arguments in pure mathematics are deductive, arguments that depend on math are deductive as well
		- *A shopper puts two apples and three oranges into a paper bag and concludes that the bag contains five pieces of fruit*
- [[Argument from Definition]]
	- a [[Deductive Argument]] in which the conclusion is claimed to depend merely on the definition of some word or phrase used in the [[Premise]] or [[Conclusion]]
		- *Someone might argue that because Claudia is mendacious, it follows that she tells lies*
			- deductive because the conclusion follows with necessity from the definition of mendacious
- [[Categorical Syllogism]]
	- a [[Syllogism]] in which all three statements are [[Categorical Proposition]]s; begins with one of the words "all," "no," or "some"
		- *All ancient forests are sources of wonder. Some ancient forests are targets of the timber industry. Therefore, some sources of wonder are targets of the timber industry.*
- [[Hypothetical Syllogism]]
	- a [[Syllogism]] having a [[Conditional Statement]] for one or both of its [[Premise]]s 
		- *If estate taxes are abolished, then wealth will accumulate disproportionately. If wealth accumulates disproportionately, then democracy will be threatened. Therefore, if estate taxes are abolished, then democracy will be threatened.*
- [[Disjunctive Syllogism]]
	- a [[Syllogism]] having a disjunctive ("either ... or...") statement for one or both of its [[Premise]]s
		- *Either global warming will be arrested, or hurricanes will become more intense. Global warming will not be arrested. Therefore, hurricanes will become more intense.*
### Inductive Argument Forms
---
- [[Prediction]]
	- an [[Inductive Argument]] that proceeds from knowledge of some event in the relative past to a claim about some other event in the relative future
		- *Someone might argue that because certain meteorological phenomena have been observed to develop over a certain region of central Missouri, a storm will occur there in six hours*
- [[Argument from Analogy]]
	- an [[Inductive Argument]] that depends on the existence of a similarity between two things or state of affairs
		- *Because Christina's Porsche is a great handling car, it follows that Angela's Porsche must also be a great handling car
			- The argument depends on the existence of a similarity, or analogy, between the two cars
- [[Generalization]]
	- An [[Inductive Argument]] that proceeds from the knowledge of a selected sample to some claim about the whole group
		- *One might argue that because three oranges selected from a certain crate were especially tasty and juicy, all the oranges from that crate are especially tasty and juicy*
			- Use statistics in inductive argumentation
- [[Argument from Authority]]
	- An [[Inductive Argument]] in which the conclusion rests on a statement made by some presumed  authority or witness, Argument from Compassion
		- *A person might argue that earnings for Hewlett-Packard Corporation will be up in the coming quarter because of a statement to that affect by an investment counselor*
			- since the counselor could be lying, the argument is essentially probabilistic 
- [[Argument based on Signs]]
	- an [[Inductive Argument]] that proceeds from the knowledge of a sign to a claim about the thing or situation that the sign symbolizes
		- *sign* meaning any kind of message (usually visually) produced by an intelligent being 
			- *When driving on an unfamiliar highway one might see a sign indicating that the road makes several sharp turns one mile ahead. Based on this information, one could argue that the road does indeed make several sharp turns one mile ahead*
				- Because the sign might be misplaced or in error about the turns, the conclusion is only probably
- [[Causal Inference]]
	- an inductive inference that proceeds from knowledge of a cause to a claim about an effect, or from the knowledge of an effect to a claim about a cause
		- Always [[Inductive Argument]]s because no effect necessarily follows from any particular cause
		- *From the knowledge that a bottle of wine had been accidentally left in the freezer overnight, someone might conclude that it had frozen (cause to effect). Conversely, after tasting a piece of chicken and finding it dry and tough, one might conclude that it had been overcooked (effect to cause)* 
### Further Considerations
---
- This list of Arguments are not mutually exclusive
	- many [[Causal Inference]]s that proceed from cause to effect also qualify as [[Prediction]]s
- **Arguments in Geometry (Deductive) v. Arguments from Analogy (Inductive Generalizations**
	- An argument concluding that a triangle has a certain attribute (such as a right angle) because another triangle, with which it is congruent, also has that attribute might be mistaken for an [[Argument from Analogy]]
	- An argument that concludes that all triangles have a certain attribute (such as angles totaling two right angles) because any particular triangle has that attribute might be mistaken for an Inductive [[Generalization]] 
- **Scientific Arguments**
	- Can be either [[Inductive Argument]]s or [[Deductive Argument]]s 
		- Arguments aimed at the *discovery* of a law of nature are usually considered [[Inductive Argument]]s
			- *If we want to discover a law that governs the time required for a falling body to strike earth. We drop bodies of various weights from various heights and measure the time it takes for them to fall. Comparing our measurements, we notice that the time is approximately proportional to the square root of the distance.. From this we conclude that the time required for any body to fall is proportional to the square root of the distance  through which it falls* - Inductive [[Generalization]]
		- Arguments meant to *apply* known laws to specific circumstances are always considered [[Deductive Argument]]s 
			- *If we want to apply Boyle's law for ideal gases to a container of gas in our lab. Boyle's law states that the pressure exerted by a gas on the walls of its containers is inversely proportional to the volume. Applying this law, we conclude that when we reduce the volume of our lab sample by half, the pressure will double.* - [[Deductive Argument]] even though it pertains to the future
- **Deductive v Inductive** (Should not be used as a criterion)
	- [[Deductive Argument]]s are those that proceed from a [[General Statement]] (a statement that makes a claim about all the members of a class) to a [[Particular Statement]] (a statement that makes a claim about one or more members of a class) 
	- [[Inductive Argument]]s are those that proceed from a [[Particular Statement]] to a [[General Statement]]
