## Notes:
- [[Fallacies of Weak Induction]]
	- a group of [[Informal Fallacy]] that occur because the connection between the [[Premise]]s and [[Conclusion]] is not strong enough to support the conclusion
### 9. Appeal to Unqualified Authority (Argumentum ad Verecundiam)
---
- [[Appeal to Unqualified Authority]]
	- An [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when an arguer cites the testimony of an unqualified authority in support of a conclusion
		- *Dr. Bradshaw, our family physician, has stated that the creation of muonic atoms of deuterium and tritium hold the key to producing a sustained nuclear fusion reaction at room temperature. In view of Dr. Bradshaw‚Äôs expertise as a physician, we must conclude that this is indeed true.*
	- Two Important Points to determine a person of qualified authority:
		- The person may be an authority in  more than one field
		- There are some areas in which practically no one can be considered an authority
			- *politics, morals, and religion*
### 10. Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)
---
- [[Appeal to ignorance]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when an arguer uses the fact that nothing has been proved about something, as evidence in support of some conclusion about that thing.
		- *People have been trying for centuries to provide conclusive evidence for the claims of astrology, and no one has ever succeeded. Therefore, we must conclude that astrology is a lot of nonsense*.
	- #### Exceptions to the appeal to ignorance
		- (1): If qualified researchers investigate a certain phenomenon within their range and fail to turn up any evidence that the phenomenon exists, this failed search itself constitutes positive evidence about the question. 
			- *Teams of scientists attempted over several decades to detect the existence of the luminiferous aether, and failed to do so. Therefore, the luminiferous aether does not exist.*
				- Inductively strong argument due to scientists searching for years to find evidence. (not deductively valid)
		- (2): Related to Courtroom procedure. A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. If the prosecutor in a criminal trial fails to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond reasonable doubt, counsel for the defense may justifiably argue that his or her client is not guilty.
			- *Members of the jury, you have heard the prosecution present its case against the defendant. Nothing, however, has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, under the law, the defendant is not guilty.*
### 11. Hasty Generalization (Converse Accident)
---
- [[Hasty Generalization]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when a general conclusion is drawn from atypical specific cases.
	- Occurs when there is a reasonable likelihood that the sample is not representative of the group
		- *Today‚Äôs money managers are a pack of thieves, every last one of them. Look at Bernie Madoff and Robert Allen Stanford. They ripped off billions of dollars from thousands of trusting clients. And Raj Rajaratnam profited to the tune of millions of dollars through illegal insider trading.*
			- A conclusion about a whole group is drawn from [[Premise]]s that mention only a few instances
		- Not all small samples are atypical, and not all large samples are guaranteed to be typical
			- Small Sample that is not atypical:
				- *Ten milligrams of substance Z was fed to four mice, and within two minutes all four went into shock and died. Probably substance Z, in this amount, is fatal to mice in general.*
					- does not commit the fallacy because there is no likelihood that the sample is atypical of the group. The fact that the mice died in only two minutes suggests the existence of a causal connection between eating substance Z and death
			- Large sample that is not typical:
				- *One hundred thousand voters from Orange County, California, were surveyed on their choice for governor, and 68 percent said they intend to vote for the Republican candidate. Clearly the Republican candidate will be elected.*
					- Orange County is overwhelmingly Republican, so 68% intend to vote for the Republican does not indicate how others in the state intend to vote. - Biased Sample
### 12. False Cause
---
- [[False Cause]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when the [[Conclusion]] of an argument depends on some imagined causal connection that probably does not exist
		- *During the past two months, every time that the cheerleaders have worn blue ribbons in their hair, the basketball team has been defeated. Therefore, to prevent defeats in the future, the cheerleaders should get rid of those blue ribbons.*
			- commits a *post hoc ergo propter hoc* ("after this, therefore on account of this")
				- presupposes that just because one event precedes another event, the first event causes the second.
		- *Successful business executives are paid salaries in excess of $100,000. Therefore, the best way to ensure that Ferguson will become a successful executive is to raise his salary to at least $100,000.*
			- commits *non causa pro causa* ("not the cause for the cause")
				- this is committed when what is taken to be the cause of something is not really the cause at all and the mistake is based on something other than mere temporal succession
				- success as an executive causes increases in salary, not the other way around, so the argument mistakes the cause for the effect
		- *There are more laws on the books today than ever before, and more crimes are being committed than ever before. Therefore, to reduce crime we must eliminate the laws.*
			- also *non causa pro causa*
				- The increase in crime is, for the most part, only coincidental with the increase in the number of laws. The mere fact that one event is coincidental with another is not good enough reason to think it caused the event.
	- *Oversimplified Cause*
		- occurs when a multitude of causes is responsible for a certain effect but the arguer selects just one of the causes and represents it as the sole cause
			- *The quality of education in our grade schools and high schools has been declining for years. Clearly, our teachers just aren‚Äôt doing their job these days.*
				- decline of quality education is caused by many factors
		- Usually motivated by self-serving interest. Wants undeserved credit 
	- [[Gambler's Fallacy]]
		- committed whenever the conclusion of an argument depends on the supposition that independent events in a game of chance are causally related
			- *A fair coin was flipped five times in a row, and each time it came up heads. Therefore, it is extremely likely that it will come up tails on the next flip.*
				- It is no more likely that the coin will come up tails on the next flip than it was on the first flip. Each flip is an independent event, so earlier flips have no causal influence on later ones. 
### 13. Slippery Slope
---
- [[Slippery Slope]]
	- an [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when the [[Conclusion]] of an argument rests on alleged chain of reaction, and there is not sufficient reason to think that the chain reaction will actually take place.
		- *Immediate steps should be taken to outlaw pornography once and for all. The continued manufacture and sale of pornographic material will almost certainly lead to an increase in sex-related crimes such as rape and incest. This in turn will gradually erode the moral fabric of society and result in an increase in crimes of all sorts. Eventually a complete disintegration of law and order will occur, leading in the end to the total collapse of civilization.*
			- attempt to persuade that the welfare of society rests on this "slippery slope" and that a single step in the wrong direction will result in inevitable slide to the bottom
	- Almost always used to defend the status quo. Make people fear change, and to fear it so much that they will cling rigidly to the prevailing state of affairs even if it is immoral.
		- "*Then a colored man might be the next governor [of states having a black majority]; and colored men might constitute their Legislature, and sit on the bench as judges in their courts. Thus the entire administration in those States would be placed in the hands of degraded men, wholly ignorant of the principles of law and government*" - Presbyterian Minister in Cincinnati, 1845 on what would happen if slavery were abolished.
	- Chains of causes is neither inevitable nor necessary. Somewhere along the line the weak links will fail. 
### 14. Weak Analogy
---
- [[Weak Analogy]]
	- An [[Informal Fallacy]] that occurs when the [[Conclusion]] of an argument depends on an analogy (or similarity) that is not strong enough to support the conclusion
		- *Amber‚Äôs dog is similar in many ways to Kyle‚Äôs cat. Both like being petted, they enjoy being around people, they beg for food at the dinner table, and they sleep with their owners. Amber‚Äôs dog loves to romp on the beach with Amber. Therefore, Kyle‚Äôs cat probably loves to romp on the beach with Kyle.*
	- Basic Structure of an [[Argument from Analogy]]
		- *Entity A has attributes¬†_a, b, c_, and¬†_z_. Entity B has attributes¬†_a, b, c_. Therefore, entity B probably has attribute¬†_z_¬†also.*
			- (1): identify that attributes *a, b, c,* that the two entities A and B Share
			- (2): determine how the attribute *z*, mentioned in the [[Conclusion]], relates to the attributes *a, b, c*
		- If some causal or systemic relation exists between *z* and *a, b,* or *c*, the argument is strong; otherwise, it is weak
		- *The flow of electricity through a wire is similar to the flow of water through a pipe. Obviously a large-diameter pipe will carry a greater flow of water than a pipe of small diameter. Therefore, a large-diameter wire should carry a greater flow of electricity than a small-diameter wire.*
			- Good Argument
			- Depend on similarity between water molecules flowing through a pipe and electrons flowing through water
			- Systemic relation between the diameter of the pipe/wire and the amount of flow
				- provides strong link between [[Premise]] and [[Conclusion]] 
		- *The flow of electricity through a wire is similar to the flow of water through a pipe. When water runs downhill through a pipe, the pressure at the bottom of the hill is greater than it is at the top. Thus, when electricity flows downhill through a wire, the voltage should be greater at the bottom of the hill than at the top.*
			- Bad Argument
			- Causal connection exists between difference in elevation and increase in pressure that holds for water but not electricity
