## Notes:
- [[Fallacy]]
	- a defect in an argument that arises from a mistake in reasoning or the creation of an illusion that makes a bad argument appear good
	- *non sequitur* ("it does not follow") is another name for fallacy
	- ### Two Groups of Fallacies
		- [[Formal Fallacy]]
			- A fallacy that can be identified by merely examining the form or structure of an argument
				- found only in [[Deductive Argument]]s that have identifiable forms
				- *All bullfights are grotesque rituals. All executions are grotesque rituals. Therefore, all bullfights are executions*
					- Follows form: All *A* are *B* - All *C* are *B* - All *A* are *C*
					- if B and C are interchanged the argument becomes valid 
		- [[Informal Fallacy]]
			- A fallacy that can be detected only through analysis of the content of an argument
				- *The Brooklyn Bridge is made of atoms. Atoms are invisible. Therefore, the Brooklyn bridge is invisible.*
					- To detect the fallacy you must know that bridges are not invisible
