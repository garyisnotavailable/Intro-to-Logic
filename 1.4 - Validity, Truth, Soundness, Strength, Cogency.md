## Notes:
### Deductive Arguments
---
- [[Valid Deductive Argument]]
	- An argument in which it is impossible for the [[Conclusion]] to be false given that the [[Premise]]s are true
		- the conclusion follows with strict **necessity** from the premises
- [[Invalid Deductive Argument]]
	- A [[Deductive Argument]] in which it is possible for the [[Conclusion]] to be false given the [[Premise]]s are true
		- conclusion **does not** follow with strict necessity from the premises
- **Testing an Argument for Validity**
	- Assume all [[Premise]]s are true
	- Determine if it is possible for the [[Conclusion]] to be false
		- *All television networks are media companies. NBC is a television network. Therefore, NBC is a media company.*
			- Both premises are true
			- If NBC is included in the group of television networks¬†(second premise) and if the group of television networks is included in the group of media companies (first premise), it necessarily follows that NBC is included in the group of media companies (conclusion).
		- *All automakers are computer manufacturers. United Airlines is an automaker. Therefore, United Airlines is a computer manufacturer.*
			- Assuming both premises are true (they are not) it is impossible for the conclusion to be false
		- *All banks are financial institutions. Wells Fargo is a financial institution. Therefore, Wells Fargo is a bank.*
			- In this case it¬†_is_¬†possible. If banks were included in one part of the group of financial institutions and Wells Fargo were included in another part, then Wells Fargo would¬†_not_¬†be a bank. In other words, assuming the premises to be true and the conclusion false does not involve any contradiction, and so the argument is invalid.
- **Validity** is not uniformly determined by the actual truth or falsity of the premises and conclusion
	- determined by the *relationship* between premises and conclusion
	- does the premise *support* the conclusion?
	- **Any** [[Deductive Argument]] having actually true premises and an actually false conclusion is an [[Invalid Deductive Argument]] 
- [[Sound Argument]]
	- a [[Deductive Argument]] that is valid and has all true [[Premise]]s 
- [[Unsound Argument]]
	- [[Deductive Argument]] that is invalid, has one or more false [[Premise]]s, or both
### Inductive Arguments
---
- [[Strong Inductive Argument]]
	- An [[Inductive Argument]] in which it is *improbable* that the [[Conclusion]] be false given that the [[Premise]]s are true
	- To be considered strong, an inductive argument must have a conclusion that is more *probable* than *improbable*
		- conclusion does follow *probably* from the premises
			- **Strong Argument**
				- *This barrel contains 100 apples. Eighty apples selected at random were found to be ripe. Therefore, probably all 100 apples are ripe*
- [[Weak Inductive Argument]]
	- an [[Inductive Argument]] in which the [[Conclusion]] **does not** follow *probably* from the [[Premise]]s even though it is claimed to do so
		- **Weak Argument**
			- *This barrel contains 100 apples. Three apples selected at random were found to be ripe. Therefore, probably all 100 apples are ripe*
- **Uniformity of Nature**
	- [[Uniformity of Nature Principle]]
		- Principle that states that the future tends to replicate the past, and regularities that prevail in one spatial region tend to prevail in other regions.
		- The basis for our judgements about what we naturally expect to occur. 
			- *In the past, sugar has always tasted sweet. According to the uniformity of nature, sugar will continue to taste sweet in the future.*
- #### Testing an inductive argument
	- Assume the [[Premise]]s are true
	- Determine whether, based on that assumption, the conclusion is *probably* true
		- linking up the premises with regularities that exist in our experiential background 
			- Example of a [[Prediction]]
				- *All dinosaur bones discovered to this day have been at least 50 million years old. Therefore, probably the next dinosaur bone to be found will be at least 50 million years old*
					- Premise is true
					- [[Uniformity of Nature Principle]] dictates that the next one discovered will also be over 50 million years old
				- *All meteorites found to this day have contained salt. Therefore, probably the next meteorite to be found will contain salt*
					- Assuming the premise is true, we could expect the next meteorite to be found with salt in it. 
			- [[Argument from Analogy]]
				- *Dom Perignon champagne, which is made in France, sells for over $100 per bottle. Marquis de la Tour is also a French champagne. Therefore probably it, too, sells for over $100 per bottle*
					- Premises are true but the background information tells us that because two wines come from the same country does not imply that they sell for the same price
					- **False** conclusion
				- *During the past fifty years, inflation has consistently reduced the value of the American Dollar. Therefore, industrial productivity will probably increase in the years ahead.*
					- **True** premise, probably **True** conclusion but the conclusion is not based on the assumption that the premise is true 
						- **Weak Argument** due to there being no relationship between conclusion and premise
- [[Total Evidence Requirement]]
	- [[Premise]]s must not exclude some crucial piece of evidence that undermines that states premises and requires a different conclusion
- [[Cogent Argument]]
	- an [[Strong Inductive Argument]] that has all true [[Premise]]s, and meets the [[Total Evidence Requirement]]
		- *Swimming in the Caribbean is usually lots of fun. Today the water is warm, the surf is gentle, and on this beach there are no dangerous currents. Therefore, it would be fun to go swimming here now*
			- If this argument were to ignore the fact that several large dorsal fins are cutting through the water (suggesting sharks) this argument would not be cogent
- [[Uncogent Argument]]
	- a [[Weak Inductive Argument]] that has one or more false [[Premise]]s, fails to meet the [[Total Evidence Requirement]] or any combination of these
